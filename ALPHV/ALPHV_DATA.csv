Dear representatives of Motel One,

Due to the lack of any response from your side, we are releasing a teaser. We have extracted 24,449,137 files, approximately 6 TB of data. This data includes PDF & RTF booking confirmations for the past 3 years (5.5 TB) containing names, addresses, dates of reservation, payment method, and contact information.
