0,PainCare ,Fri Sep 22 2023,"September 13th network of the ""PainCare Specialists"" pain management provider's company was breached by our team. 

As a result of our hack attack the network has been encrypted and over 150GB of sensitive data were stolen from there. Those data includes patient's and employee's medical records, social security numbers, employees ID's, contracts, drug screens, payments and another sensitive info. In addition we have gained access to portals of federal medical regulation web-resources that allows managing of prescribed medicine and provides access to medical records of various individuals.

Top management of PainCare Specialists headed by president Poly Chen refused to contact us and protect data of their employees and patients, that decision violates their own policy which states that ""Patients can expect that all communications and records about their care will be confidential, unless disclosure is allowed by law"" We have faced complete indifference from Poly Chen, Yonguen Cho, David Keen, Donald Winder and other top management representative of this business. They are receiving and reading our messages but still refusing to answer.

That is why now everyone can see example of files stolen from PainCare Specialists which includes data supposed to be protected by Mr.Poly Chen and his team. In case if Mr.Chen and his team will not contact us until September 
26th. All the data related to PainCare Specialists will be released for free. 

Anyway we are giving another chance to PainCare Specialists to contact us until September 26th and protect data of their employees and patients"

Reading this is kind of fun, because top management of the Seiko Group has been provided with all the necessary details about breach and our contacts. 

Good to see that third party people can specify what happened to their network. We were able to give them this information for free in case if they have contacted us. 

Unfortunately, we didn't received any messages from Seiko yet. At the moment this situation looks like Seiko Group just trying to win time to develop anti-leak strategy and further plan to minimize losses from critical data's leak. 

Our team have promised not to share data of Seiko Group, but right now it is over 23 days passed since data breach occurred and we still didn't received any messages from them. Such behavior is unacceptable for people trying or at least making anything to protect their data. That is why we made a conclusion that Seiko Group and their top management do not understand what are they doing, relying on third party specialists. While we absolutely sure that these paid ""advisors"" can't do anything to decrypt Seiko's network and furthermore can not return stolen data. 

We have already shared some of Seiko's data to spread some news and make it clear to their management. Since they do not understand what are they doing, we will continue to post their files partly until all their data will be uploaded or Seiko Group contact us, whichever occures first. Probably one of these third party ""specialists"" or their representative advised Seiko Group not to contact us and rely on government and police, this is literally the worst advise could be given.

organisations can't do anything with decrypt and data recovery. "

0,Seiko Group Corporation,Mon Aug 21 2023,"Important update regarding Seiko's data breach. 

We want to inform anyone who is interested in details about data Seiko's data breach, with following statement. 

Unfortunatelly we didn't received any response from Seiko Group yet. That's why we have started leaking their files. 

Supposingly their top management doesn't completely realised yet what is going on with their network and files. We can prove our statements with more file samples and 
screenshots of internal emails, showing that their IT-department can not do anything useful.And this is why they are hiring more third-party people to make useless job 
trying find out what happened. 

We have offered Seiko's top management our help. We can give them everything they need to recover network and files. we will also provide details about network 
improvements which will help them to avoid further security incidients, and completely destroy stolen data. But somehow they refuse to negotiate and we honestly don't 
know why they refusing to protect their business. 

The Fact that we didn't post or sell any Seiko's important data yet, which total volume is over 2TB, btw, shows that we care more about their reputation than their 
management do. We have a lot of interesteing data for sure, like employees working routes, employees family details, production technologies, emails, management 
meetings video and audio records, foreign visitors and employees passport scans, etc. As you can see Seiko made official statement about this breach August 10th, while 
we have screenshots of their emails dated 8/15/23, showing their helplessness. 

As a Men of Business we will hold their data for a while, looking for a good side deal option as a Plan B meanwhile. This will give Seiko a chance to contact us to 
recover their data and stop this nonsense. But in case if Seiko will completely refuse to negotiate - worst things may happen.The price becomes higher for Seiko with 
every second of our time they wasted. Once the price reaches critical spot or waiting for a response from them will be too long, it is almost 3 weeks already, we will 
stop waiting for an answer from them and trying to protect their business. This will mean that their time for answer run out and possibility to protect their business 
is closed. 

Since Seiko is not a regular company, and we are sharing they will to become number 1 in the world, we are ready to wait for response. But not a single business 
deserves to be waited forever. 

Our team hopes that someone can bring this statement to Seiko's management clearly. Would be good for their business. 

We will share samples of Seiko's files including confidential files and provide details about this data breach to any representative of newsmakers companies or 
independent reporters contacted us through seiko2023@tutanota.com

It is constantly committed to improve its know-how and competences in the automation markets and to develop more modern measurement gauges and sensors in order to face the global market with ever greater impulsion. Its leading position is the result of a combination of state-of-the-art technology with an experienced research and development team enabling the Company to offer high-quality systems – absolutely essential for the safe and efficient management of the entire production process in the rubber and plastic industry.

Together with a highly-performing production plant in Momo, in the province of Novara, with a staff of 100 persons including highly-specialised engineers and technicians, Electric Systems has strategic Customer Service offices in Germany, France, Spain, China, Poland, Brazil, North and South America to provide fast and reliable on-site after-sales services.

Its positioning, the never-ending effort to increase the corporate expertise and competitiveness in the automation market as well as to develop the latest gauges and sensors in order to meet the requirements of the global market and the quality-oriented corporate policy have enabled Electric Systems to become one of the few Italian companies with a prominent position on the hard quality-focused German market, to fit about 90% of the rubber plants existing in China with its measurement systems and to reach an annual turnover exceeding 18 million Euros, as well as a yearly production capability of 2500 thickness measurement gauges.

The new technologies created by the R&amp;D department has led to the registration of innovative patents for Beta sensor measurement systems and for air-sensor thickness measurement systems and the corporate quality policy has resulted in the certification of a Quality Management System and a Management System according to ISO 9001:2008.

The international corporate role is supported by the Company presence in the most important trade fairs and exhibitions, such as, Stretch &amp; Shrink Film Cologne 2014, Specialty Packaging Films Asia 2014, ITEC Tire Manufacturing Akron 2014 and Chinaplast 2014 in Pudong, China. In 2013, Electronic Systems exhibited in Pack Expo in Las Vegas, NV, USA, ICE Europe in Munich, Multilayer Packfilms in Wien, Rubber Tech China, K 2013 in Düsserldorf, Stretch &amp; Shrink Film in Cologne. Further back in time, it was present at “Plast” in Milan, “Equiplast” in Barcelona, “Europlast” in Paris, “Index” in Geneva, “Tire Expo” in Germany and “Rubbertech China” in China.

Eletronic Systems also actively attends many international events and conferences. On June 2014, our CEO, Mr. Stefano Trizzino, took part in the last edition of AMI’s 5th North American conference on Multilayer Packaging Films held in Chicago presenting a paper entitled
“Measuring Thickness on line to reduce waste and save money during production of multilayer packaging film! Why measuring thickness online – how to save money reducing waste and complaints“. On 2013, the Company participated in many conferences: Polyethylene films 2013 in Daytona, PET in Milan, Blown + PET-PP-PLA rigid films in Bangkok, Multilayer packaging in Chicago, BOPP film 2013 in Singapore, Multilayer pack films in Wien and Flexible pack Middle East in Abu Dhabi, highlighting once again the corporate commitment to increase its expertise and worldwide relevance."

0, SUMITOMO BAKELITE | sbna-inc.com,Fri Oct 28 2022,"Among the various plastics, phenolic resin has the oldest history. It was developed by Dr. Leo H. Baekeland, an American of Belgian ancestry, in 1907 and he named that synthetic resin ""Bakelite"". In 1911, Sankyo Company (currently Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd.) was assigned the rights to execute the patents in Japan through the good offices of Dr. Jokichi Takamine, a close friend of Dr. Baekeland. Trial production of phenolic resin was started at the Shinagawa Plant of Sankyo Company. That was the origin of the Japan's plastics industry, and the name of our company came from this achievement.

In 1932, phenolic resin business of Sankyo Co., Ltd. was separated and formed Nippon Bakelite Co., Ltd. In 1955, Nippon Bakelite Co., Ltd. merged with Sumitomo Synthetic Resin Industries, Ltd. to found Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd. As a pioneer in plastics, with our expertise in and up-to-date facilities for plastics, we have been always developing new technologies for use in various fields in order to contribute to establishing safe and comfortable living."
